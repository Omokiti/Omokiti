### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github Profile. Please feel free to check out my projects built with HTML, Css, JavaScript, React and Node.js.

I am a Software Engineer who enjoys creating beautiful user interfaces and APIs using suitable web technologies and following best practices.

I also enjoy learning, writing and documenting about things I learn.

When I am not coding, you can find me listening to music, watching a movie, reading a novel and hiking(when I visit the northern part of Nigeria).
